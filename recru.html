			  <h1>NTU Master students</h1> 
			  I am happy to advise master students on their dissertation, course projects or others. Please email me with the following:
			  <ul>
				<li>a brief description of who you are, your course information, research interests, and your past research experiences,</li>
				<li>your CV,</li>

	<h1>NTU undergraduate students</h1> 
<p>I am quite happy to work with motivated and curious NTU undergraduate students on either final-year projects or others. If you are interested, please reach out to me via email with the following information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a brief description of who you are (e.g. year and major) and why you are interested in the lab,</li>
	<li>a list of classes that you have taken or are taking in computer science, machine learning, statistics, AI, computer vision or other related fields,</li>
	<li>your expected time commitment (hours per week) and when you would like to work (e.g. summer, during semester),</li>
	<li>any prior research experiences and the supervising faculty member(s) (optional,  as I do not expect undergraduates to have previous research experience),</li>
	<li>any other relevant information (e.g. course projects, website).</li>
  </ul>

<p>This information will allow me to assess your fit in the lab and help match you to a relevant research project. If there is a good fit, then I will schedule a time to meet.

I require a substantial time commitment from undergraduates in my lab (e.g., at least one semester), so please only reach out if you truly have the time and motivation. Many of the undergraduate students I have mentored have published papers in top venues (e.g. ICLR, CVPR oral).</p>

<hr/>
	<h1>Others</h1> 
<p>I am happy to host a few (1 or 2) visiting students (onsite or remote), research assistants, and interns in my lab, starting from the summer of 2025. Please email  me with the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>a brief description of who you are, your research interests, and your past research experiences,</li>
		<li>your CV,</li>
		<li>one representative paper if any, and</li>
		<li>any other relevant information (e.g. past projects, coursework, etc).</li>
	  </ul>
	
	<p>I will offer funding for these positions depending on the situation. A time commitment of at least one semester is required. There are many scholarships at NTU available to help fund your work, such as CFAR INTERNSHIP AWARD FOR RESEARCH EXCELLENCE (CIARE), A*STAR RESEARCH INTERNSHIP AWARD (ARIA), SINGAPORE INTERNATIONAL PRE-GRADUATE AWARD (SIPGA), NTU Global Connect Fellowship. Please refer to <a href="https://a0091624.wixsite.com/deepneurocognition-1/join-us" target="_blank"  rel="noreferrer">  Prof. Mengmi Zhang's webpage</a> for more details w.r.t. the scholarship (I personally found it is very useful!).</p>
