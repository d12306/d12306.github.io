	<h1>NTU undergraduate students</h1> 
<p>I am quite happy to work with motivated and curious NTU undergraduate students on either final-year projects or others. If you are interested, please reach out to me via email with the following information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a brief description of who you are (e.g. year and major) and why you are interested in the lab,</li>

I require a substantial time commitment from undergraduates in my lab (e.g., at least one semester), so please only reach out if you truly have the time and motivation. Many of the undergraduate students I have mentored have published papers in top venues (e.g. ICLR, CVPR oral).</p>

		<li>your CV,</li>
		<li>one representative paper if any, and</li>
		<li>any other relevant information (e.g. past projects, coursework, etc).</li>
	  </ul>
	
	<p>I will offer funding for these positions depending on the situation. A time commitment of at least one semester is required. There are many scholarships at NTU available to help fund your work, please refer to <a href="https://a0091624.wixsite.com/deepneurocognition-1/join-us" target="_blank"  rel="noreferrer">  Prof. Mengmi Zhang's webpage</a> for more details w.r.t. the scholarship (I personally found it is very useful!).</p>
